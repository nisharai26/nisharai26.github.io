<h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
       I am  dedicated and open-minded. I have never give-up attitude and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills 
       and learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities based on my recent training in Code Nation and past education and experiences.
       I am also associated with Code Your Future as an Volunteer in their education team and involve in teaching the JavaScript.
        I love doing Yoga and cooking in my free time.
        I love spending time with my family and watching good movies , spritual and unknown history of the world.
